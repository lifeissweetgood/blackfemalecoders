   <p class="balance-text" style="font-family:Titillium Web; text-indent: 20px; text-align:justify;">As a <span id="highlight">BFC</span>, I have not had the pleasure of coming across too many others like me.  Throughout the course of my education, I have been lucky to meet a handful but as I left college and started working, I found it more and more difficult.  While I have many awesome coder friends of all racial/ethnic/gender backgrounds, the feeling I get from meeting another BFC is just a little different from the one I get when I meet other coders: <span id="highlight">BFCs tend to just get me a little more</span>.  And I think they often get me because a lot of us have been through somewhat similar experiences: being one of very few &mdash; if not the only &mdash; women and/or black people in our classes; having struggled at some point in time with wondering if we chose the right field and feeling like the pressure (either from our workload or our families or ourselves or the world in general) is just too much; being sometimes made to feel as if we for some reason are incapable of producing work as great as our fellow CS peers.  There have been days when I found myself mired in self-doubt and wondering how many other BFCs like me also found themselves silently dealing with this.  Having to deal with it on my own has been a lonely and difficult journey but over time I&#39;ve realized <span id="highlight">I no longer have to nor do I want to deal with this alone</span> and <span id="highlight">other BFCs don&#39;t have to either</span>.  We may not be at a place yet in our society where our numbers in classrooms allow us to bump into each other often in the physical world but, in the meantime, <span id="highlight">we can use a medium we all know best: our computers</span>.</p><br>
   <p style="font-family:Titillium Web; text-indent: 20px; text-align:justify;">This site is for us to <span id="highlight">connect</span>.  It&#39;s a place for us to <span id="highlight">share</span> practical advice (ex: tips for surviving undergrad and/or grad school or tips on how to land a job) but also a place for us to share the not-so-obvious pearls of wisdom we&#39;ve picked up throughout our experiences in the field.  It&#39;s a <span id="highlight">supportive space</span> to share what we&#39;ve learned and <span id="highlight">inspire</span> each other and hopefully pull each other up if we find ourselves needing help.</p><br>
   <p class="balance-text" style="font-family:Titillium Web; text-indent: 20px; text-align:center;"><span id="highlight" style="font-size:22px;">This site needs to exist because we exist.<br> It&#39;s about time we make our presence really known.</span></p><br>
   <p style="font-family:Titillium Web; text-indent: 20px; text-align:center;">Your girl,</p><br>
